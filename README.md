I am a staff scientist working on bioinformatics analysis with focus on lymphoma biology. I have been working on several projects including identification of the binding of PRDM1 transcriptional factor across genome of NK cells and corrlated with gene expression and chromatin accessiblity change between two distinct culture conditions; identification of differnential expression, methylation, H3L27ac, and 5hmc induced by TET2 knockout in CD4+ T cells through RNA-seq, single cell RNA-seq, RRBS, H3K27ac-seq, and hMeDIP-seq; characterization of genomic features in several Double-hit/triple-hit cell lines, and drug-resistant cell lines through RNA-seq and WES-seq; identification of mutations and CNV in a cohort of DLBCL patients with HIV. Within these folders are my pipelines for different high-throuput sequencing data and my specific analyses for different projects.
